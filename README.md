**_`learn and execute.`_**

## **Learn Java and Spring Boot with me**

- **_Java_** was developed by 🧑🏼‍💻**_James Gosling_** at 🌞**_Sun Microsystems_** in the year 1995.
- As **_Java_** is an object-oriented programming language and a popular one, Microsoft has come to buy Java, \***\*but 🌞**Sun Microsystems\*\* was strong and did not sell Java.
- Later the acquisition of 🌞**_Sun Microsystems_** by **_Oracle Corporation_** was completed on January 27, 2010.
- Java was in high demand because of its features of Java and is used for programming applications on the web, mobile, desktop, etc. using different platforms.
- Also, it’s multiple security, dynamic coding, platform-independent characteristics, etc

## **_Getting Started_**

It’s all about **_Java_** so nothing much to have in your 🖥️**_System_**, only the **_JAVA JDK_** is fine to work with.

And **_Spring boot_** will come in handy. Once you learn **_Java, Spring Boot_** will be easy to learn.

## **_Pre-requisites_**

- You can use your **notepad** which is already in your 🖥️**System**.
- It’s better 😌 to use **IDE,** this **IDE** gives some shortcuts while writing code.
- I prefer to use **VS Code** because it is used for all programming languages. But most of them use different **_IDE_** for different languages. If you want to work only with **Java** it’s better to use **_Eclipse_** and **_IntelliJ,_** these will provide more faster process speed towards **Java** because they are used to work only on \***_Java_.\***
