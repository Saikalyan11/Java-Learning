**###Learn Java and Spring Boot with me###**

- **Java** was developed by 🧑🏼‍💻**James Gosling** at 🌞**Sun Microsystems** in the year 1995.
- As **Java** is an object-oriented programming language and a popular one, Microsoft has come to buy Java, ****but 🌞**Sun Microsystems** was strong and did not sell Java.
- Later the acquisition of 🌞**Sun Microsystems** by **Oracle Corporation** was completed on January 27, 2010.
- Java was in high demand because of its features of Java and is used for programming applications on the web, mobile, desktop, etc. using different platforms.
- Also, it’s multiple security, dynamic coding, platform-independent characteristics, etc

**###Getting Started###**
It’s all about **Java** so nothing much to have in your 🖥️**System**, only the **JAVA JDK** is fine to work with.

And **Spring boot** will come in handy. Once you learn **Java, Spring Boot** will be easy to learn.

**###Pre-requisites###**

- You can use your **notepad** which is already in your 🖥️**System**.
- It’s better 😌 to use **IDE,** this **IDE** gives some shortcuts while writing code.
- I prefer to use **VS Code** because it is used for all programming languages. But most of them use different ***IDE*** for different languages. If you want to work only with **Java** it’s better to use ***Eclipse*** and ***IntelliJ,*** these will provide more faster process speed towards **Java** because they are used to work only on ****Java*.***
