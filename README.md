## **Learn Java and Spring Boot with me**

- **_Java_** was developed by 🧑🏼‍💻**James Gosling** at 🌞**Sun Microsystems** in the year 1995.
- As **_Java_** is an object-oriented programming language and a popular one, Microsoft has come to buy Java, **but 🌞Sun Microsystems** was strong and did not sell Java.
- Later the acquisition of 🌞**Sun Microsystems** by **Oracle Corporation** was completed on January 27, 2010.
- Java was in high demand because of its features of Java and is used for programming applications on the web, mobile, desktop, etc. using different platforms.
- Also, it’s multiple security, dynamic coding, platform-independent characteristics, etc

## **Getting Started**

It’s all about **Java** so nothing much to have in your 🖥️**System**, only the **JAVA JDK** is fine to work with.

And **Spring boot** will come in handy. Once you learn **Java, Spring Boot** will be easy to learn.

## **Pre-requisites**

- You can use your **notepad** which is already in your 🖥️**System**.
- It’s better 😌 to use **IDE,** this **IDE** gives some shortcuts while writing code.
- I prefer to use **VS Code** because it is used for all programming languages. But most of them use different **_IDE_** for different languages. If you want to work only with **Java** it’s better to use **_Eclipse_** and **_IntelliJ,_** these will provide more faster process speed towards **Java** because they are used to work only on **Java.**

## **Installation**

- Want to learn with my code by editing:

- It’s pretty straightforward⏩ :

```git clone <repository url> ```

## **Built with**

A lot of interest and love with little Java and Spring boot.

## **Contributing**

Make a repo in your git-hub and learn accordingly with me and complete with me.

To contribute with my code make pull request which improves the functionality of the application in any sort. It should confirm the following conditions.

- Clear, short, crisp description of the learning modules.
- should add to the value of the application.
